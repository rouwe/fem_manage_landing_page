## My process

I started by diving the page into smaller sections and tackling each one at a time. Starting at the top to bottom while adding some functionality using vanilla JavaScript when an interaction is required. I also used a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox for laying out things. I've used a lot of pseudo elements for backgrounds instead of empty divs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project. I've come to understand a little bit about the used of pseudo-elements. Also, I found out that using empty divs is considered a bad practice, specially for accessibility.

### Continued development

I will be focusing more on fundamentals of creating a website.
